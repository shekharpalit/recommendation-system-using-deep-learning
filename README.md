Step 5: The input you need to give the login credentials, we have only given four names because we don’t have any registration system, and all the user data available on the dataset and we’re merging that with those 4 names, if you want to test it with any random user then run the recommendation.ipynb file on jupyter notebook or google colab (Shekhar, Shamant, Jim, Jackie Chan.) for password give anything. (Important note: don't provide any kind spaces after the login credentials such as space After username "Shekhar ").
Step 6: after giving the input say "Recommend me" to the system by clicking on the username textbox.
Step 7: Check your result on the result page.
